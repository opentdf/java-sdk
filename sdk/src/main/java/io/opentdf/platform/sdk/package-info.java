 * serves as the centerpiece for this package, representing a software development kit
 * that facilitates integration with the OpenTDF services. The package also includes
 * classes for various encryption and decryption operations such as {@link io.opentdf.platform.sdk.AesGcm}
 * and its inner classes, as well as support for assertions and configurations through
 * classes like {@link io.opentdf.platform.sdk.AssertionConfig} and {@link io.opentdf.platform.sdk.Config}.
 * Additionally, utility classes such as {@link io.opentdf.platform.sdk.CryptoUtils} and
 * functionality for reading and writing TDF files are provided via {@link io.opentdf.platform.sdk.TDFReader}
 * and {@link io.opentdf.platform.sdk.TDFWriter}. The package also defines a collection of
 * enums for various configurations and state definitions, alongside a comprehensive
 * set of exceptions to handle different error scenarios, ensuring robust and secure
